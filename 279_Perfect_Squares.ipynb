    "Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.\n",

    "The answers given in most of the articles are based on a theorem: the four-square theorem .\n",
    "\n",
    "The four-square theorem says that any positive integer can be expressed as the sum of squares of no more than four integers. In other words, the answer to this question is only the four possibilities of 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, there is a very important inference that satisfies the number n of the square sum theorem (which is composed of four numbers and less than four), and must satisfy n = 4 a * (8b + 7).\n",

    "Suppose dp[i] records to least number of perfect square numbers that sum up to i. And there are multiple ways for perfect square numbers to sum up to i.\n",
    "\n",
    "The candidate way is to add a perfect square number j*j to a sum of perfect square numbers that equals to i. And it can be generized as i-j*j + j*j. So the least number of perfect square numbers that sum up to i-j*j is dp[i-j*j]. So candidate answer is dp[i-j*j]+1(add one more number j*j).\n",
