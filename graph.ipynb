    "Now, say our starting node is eventually safe if and only if we must eventually walk to a terminal node.  More specifically, there exists a natural number K so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than K steps.\n",

We mark a node gray on entry, and black on exit. If we see a gray node during our DFS, it must be part of a cycle. In a naive view, we'll clear the colors between each search.\n",
